        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter with canola oil in a large pot then add the flour.</li>
            <li>Keep cooking and stirring until this mixture (the roux) has turned to a light chocolate color. We are basically browning the butter (but not burning it!) This will take some time so be patient.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onion, bell pepper and celery. In cajun and creole cooking, this is called the "holy trinity." Similar to the French version of "mirepoix." Continue to cook, stirring for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped garlic, stir for two more minutes.</li>
            <li>Lastly, add the canned tomatoes, half of the seafood stock, the bay leaves and the seasoning. Stir well and cover. Allow to simmer.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet (12”) add the 2 Tablespoons of canola oil and the chopped okra (add okra while oil is still cool).</li>
            <li>Turn heat to medium, then add the sliced sausage. Sauté in the skillet, stirring often for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the sausage looks like it’s caramelized somewhat and is sticking to the pan some – and the okra is nice and soft, use the remaining stock to pour a little into the skillet and scrape up the stuck bits (this adds great flavor to the gumbo).A dd these contents to the pot with everything else and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for about 45-60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a bowl add the shrimp and crab boil to the shrimp and stir so that all the shrimp has been coated. Cover the bowl and store in the refrigerator until you’re ready to use it.</li>
            <li>10 minutes before you’re ready to eat, add the shrimp to the gumbo and stir well. Cover again and cook on low for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove bay leaves. Add chopped green onions. Offer Gumbo Filé if anyone likes it.</li>
            <li>Serve with rice</li>
        </ol>
